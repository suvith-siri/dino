         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the most recent years, food waste has become a complex phenomenon attracting the attention of scientists, consumers, and activists alike. It’s been termed as a global paradox regarding the manner in which emphasis is put on agriculture to improve food security and then a third of all the food produced ends up as waste. This is according to FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) report in 2013 indicating that the food waste globally sums to one-third of the total food produced for human consumption, about 1.6 billion tons a year."<br>

          <h3><b>various causes of food waste:-</b></h3><br>
          <ol><li><b>Lack of appropriate planning:-<b></li><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the top contributors to food wastage is because of a lack of appropriate planning on the consumer part. Sometimes people buy lots of food without appropriately making plans on when and how the food will be prepared for consumption. Coupled with the contemporary schedules of work and appointments, people, therefore, tend to change food preparation plans or fail to remember using it on time.<br>
          <li><b>purchase and preparation of too much food:-</b></li><br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the time, food is also wasted because of purchasing or preparing too much. If one purchases or prepares too much food than is needed, then it’s obvious the excess food on the plate will go to waste. In such scenarios, leftovers and partially used food account for the food that goes to waste.<br>
          <li><b>errors in industrial processing and keeping up with food safety policies:-</b></li></br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another biggest driving factor for food wastage is the protocol on food safety. The food safety protocols give no room for error in industrial processing or any other compromise that diminish the quality of the final food products. As such, the confusions and errors during industrial processing of food mean that all food items that don’t meet the set standards are wasted.<br>
          <li><b>managerial,financial and technical constraints:-</b></li></br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is mainly a challenge contributing to food wastage in developing countries. The wastage takes place because of the constraints to do with a lack of proper management, inadequate finances, and technical difficulties in the lines of harvesting methods, storage, and cooling problems in adverse weather conditions, processing, packaging, infrastructure, and marketing systems.<br></ol>



          <h3><b>effects of food waste:-</b></h3><br>
          <ol><li><b>biodiversity loss:-</b></li><br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food wastage impacts on biodiversity loss at a global level. In order to maximize agricultural yields, farmers have increasingly invaded wild areas in search of more fertile lands which has led to the loss of biodiversity. The reason for this is that practices such as slash and burn, deforestation, and conversion of wild areas into farmlands have destroyed the natural habitats for birds, fish, mammals, and amphibians.<br>
          <li><b>Wastage of the 1/3 of the world fertile land areas:-</b></li><br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to research, the produced but unconsumed food accounts for approximately 1.4 billion hectares of land, constituting almost 1/3 of the planet’s agricultural land. By looking at this from a well thought analytical angle, the world is wasting 30 percent of the world’s fertile land which could be used for other meaningful purposes such as environmental research.<br>
          <li><b>Increased carbon footprint and the acceleration of climate change</b></li><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The food produced and then later goes to waste is estimated to be equivalent to 3.3 billion tons of greenhouse gas emission, accelerating the impacts of climate change. Research also has it that food waste is the third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases.<br>
          <li><b>Economic consequences</b></li><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the environmental impacts, food wastage also results in direct economic costs. According to FAO’s report estimates, the economic losses associated with food wastage is about $750 billion dollars per annum.<br></ol>



         <h3><b>amazing solutions to food waste</b></h3><br>
         <ol><li><b>Balancing food production with demand</b></li><br>
          <ul><li>Foremost, precedence should be centered on balancing food production with the demand to reduce the problem of food wastage. The first thing is to cut back on the use of natural resources in food production. In hotels, restaurants, and the foodservice industry, risk management tools can be applied.</li><br>
          <li>Such a tool will work towards ensuring managers and chefs only produce and cook food in accordance with demand or the orders made. Producing large batches of food has always resulted in food wastage. So in trying to save food, labor, and money, hotels and the entire foodservice industry should work on the production of small batches or use the cook-to-order option.</li></ul><br>
          <li><b>Bettering food harvesting, storage, processing, and distribution processes</b></li><br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second strategy should be placed on developing efficient technologies and production systems that better storage, harvesting, processing, and distribution processes. Redistribution can be the initial strategy for supplying or distributing more food to where there is a need and reducing supply where food is in surplus.Harvesting, storage, and processing should also be improved by governments and NGOs by availing subsidies and training on better production practices, especially in developing countries.
         <li><b>Food waste reduction initiatives</b></li><br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supermarkets, retail food outlets, big restaurants, and individual consumers all alike can also work on their own tailored and creative efforts to reduce food footprint.For instance, individual consumers can cut back their food footprint by not necessarily placing a high preference for the very best food quality.<br></ol>
